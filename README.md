# Python-scripts
Some smaller scripts

## About
The scripts are a kind of "exercise" to keep my Python knowledge and capabilities on an advanced/proficient 
level when I am building other projects or learning a new language.
There are not many in here because I don't upload all of my stuff and that is just because I am still learning
GitHub and version control etc. so the Repos serve more as a "cloud storage" for my scripts.
